## Desired Ends
- a "soft" resume, suitable for professional context, career growth, personal branding and networking -- my single page elevator pitch.
- a place to house "growth" notes -- notes taken for personal development, career growth and sheer curiousity
  - creating notes should be a breeze
  - reading notes should be a beeze. this includes easily finding them via a simple keyword search.
  - these should be public-indexable as well.
- tertiary goal: a place to house writings, like a blog post, etc. (not a big deal for now. And not slated for v1.)

## Style
- Bare bone essentialism. If you can remove it, remove it.
- In the minimalism, be as expressive as possible, without infusing cruft.
- Push users to actions by design, not by choice.
- Limit choice in all things.
- Reveal as much as possible.

## Mode
I own all the content. Centralized control players booted from the picture.
  - handshake tld
  - files on ipfs
  - fleek hosting (suspect)

## Form

- /notes page. (search and list notes)
- individual notes pages
- home page as all encompassing, soft resume/intro page
- orphan pages:
  - connect page (dlink?)(list my links)(dead page)(used when other sites call for it or for when very very brief intro is needed)
  - real resume, pdf?
