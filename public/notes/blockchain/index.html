        <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<ul>
<li>The page is what we call a <strong>Block</strong>.</li>
<li>Date time provided on screen B is what we call the <strong>timestamp</strong> of the block.</li>
<li>Number X is known as a <strong>nonce</strong>. It is <strong>the number that the nodes of the blockchain network try to find</strong> to reach the output <strong>number that respects the rule given by the wall</strong>.</li>
<li>The process of finding number X is called <strong>mining</strong>.</li>
<li>The rule given by the wall is called a <strong>hash function</strong>.</li>
<li>We will see what the <strong>reference number</strong> is, in later sections.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="hash-function">Hash Function</h2>
<p>A <strong>hash function</strong> is a mathematical function that <strong>transforms</strong> any chain of characters or numbers <strong>into a fixed-length chain of characters</strong>. It turns data into a digital fingerprint called a hash.</p>
<p><strong>SHA</strong> stands for <strong>Secure Hash Algorithm</strong> and is a set of cryptographic hash functions designed by the US National Security Agency. <strong>SHA-256</strong> means that it is a hash function <strong>producing a 256-bit-long</strong> output.</p>
<h2 id="why-work">Why Work?</h2>
<p>Now, why should every villager try to find number X since somebody is going to find it anyway and tell everyone else? <strong>Why should a villager spend time and effort to have his/her page validated</strong> and displayed on the wall?</p>
<p>We introduce here the <strong>incentive mechanism</strong>, an <strong>economic payoff for the community to play fair</strong>. Because the pages should keep being sealed to keep the transactions accurate, <strong>the community should continuously work on solving the mathematical problem</strong>. In this manner, <strong>a reward is given to the villager who finds number X</strong>, that is, the <strong>first villager to find the correct hash of the page</strong>.</p>
<p>This incentive mechanism ensures that everyone keeps interested in working for the common good.</p>
<h2 id="reference-number">Reference Number</h2>
<p>So, what is the reference number? Remember that, on page #1, the reference number was 0?</p>
<p>For page #2, it will be 0031993. Exactly! The reference number of page #2 is the output number found for the previous page. In technical terms, we call it <strong>the previous hash</strong> or the hash value of the previous block. <strong>This allows the pages to be linked with one another</strong>, or to be <strong>chained to one another</strong>.</p>
