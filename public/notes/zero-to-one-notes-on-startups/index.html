        <h2 id="the-challenge-of-the-future-ch-1">The Challenge of The Future, Ch 1</h2>
<p>&quot;What important truth do very few people agree with you on?&quot;</p>
<p>A good answer looks like: &quot;Most people believe in x, but the truth is the opposite of x&quot;</p>
<p>The future is simply the set of all moments yet to come..the world looks different from today...it's going to be different, and <strong>it must be rooted in today's world</strong>. Most answers to the contrarian question are different ways of seeing the present; <strong>good answers are as close as we can come to looking into the future.</strong></p>
<p>Future progress can take on one of two forms:</p>
<p><strong>Horizontal progress</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>copying things that work</li>
<li>1 to n</li>
<li>AKA <strong>globalization</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Vertical progress</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>doing new things</li>
<li><strong>0 to 1</strong></li>
<li><strong>technology</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="startup-thinking">Startup Thinking</h3>
<p><strong>New technology</strong> tends to come from new ventures — <strong>startups</strong>...small groups of people bound together by a sense of mission have changed the world for the better.</p>
<ul>
<li>it's hard to develop new things in big organizations</li>
<li>it's even harder to do it alone</li>
</ul>
<p>Startups operate on the principle that you need to work with other people to get stuff done. <strong>A new company's more important strength is new thinking.</strong></p>
<h2 id="party-like-it-s-1999-ch-2">Party Like It's 1999, Ch 2</h2>
<p>If you can identify a <strong>delusional popular belief</strong>, you can find what <strong>lies hidden behind it</strong>: the <strong>contrarian truth.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Convential beliefs</strong> only ever come to <strong>appear arbitrary and wrong in retrospect</strong>; whenever one collapses, we call the old belief a bubble.</p>
<h2 id="all-happy-companies-are-different-ch-3">All Happy Companies are Different, Ch 3</h2>
<p>The business version of our contrarian question is: <strong>what valuable company is nobody building?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Creating value is not enough</strong> — you also need to <strong>capture some of the value you create</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Monopoly lies</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>usually exagerate the power of their (nonexistent) competition</li>
<li><strong>disguise their monopoly</strong> by framing their market as the <strong>union of several large markets</strong></li>
<li>ex. Google: search engine ∪ mobile phones ∪ wearable computers ∪ self-driving cars</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Competitive lies</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>understate the scale of competition, define your market extremely narrowly so that you dominate it by definition</li>
<li><strong>exagerate their distinction</strong> by defining their market as the <strong>intersection of various smaller markets</strong></li>
<li>ex.: British food ∩ restaurant ∩ Palo Alto</li>
</ul>
<p>In business, <strong>money</strong> is either an <strong>important thing or it is everything</strong>. <strong>Monopolists</strong> can afford to <strong>think about things other than making money;</strong>...only one thing can allow a businesss to transcend the daily struggle for survival: <strong>monopoly profits</strong>.</p>
<p>Creative monopolists give customers more choices by adding entirely new categories of abundance to the world.</p>
<p>All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way. Business is the opposite. <strong>All happy companies are different: each one earns a monopoly by solving a unique problem.</strong> All failed companies are the same: they failed to escape competition.</p>
