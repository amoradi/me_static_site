<blockquote>
<p><strong>Fundamental analysis</strong> will <strong>reveal</strong> if an investment is <strong>worthy of long-term capital allocation</strong>, while technical analysis will assist with the timing of buys and sells.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Look at <strong>intrinsic value drivers</strong> of an asset. E.g. with stocks, evaluating operating health via examining: </p>
<ul>
<li>income statement</li>
<li>balance sheet</li>
<li>cash flow statement</li>
<li>in the context of long-term vision and macroeconimic exposure</li>
<li>price to earnings</li>
<li>price to sales</li>
<li>book value</li>
<li>return on equity</li>
</ul>
<p>Sell-side research for cryptoassets is non-existant/nascent. Onus is on the innovative crypto investor to do his/her own research.</p>
<p>Fundamental analysis for cryptoassets is different from that of stocks because cryptoassets are <em>not necessarily companies</em>. The asset may have been created by a company, and an understanding of that company is vital, but the <strong>cryptoassets themselves should be valued more as commodities</strong>, with <strong>markets priced by the balance of supply and demand</strong>.</p>
<p>Fundamental analysis for a cryptoasset performed via examining its:</p>

<h2 id="white-paper">White Paper</h2>
<p>&quot;Vagueness is not your friend&quot;. If a white paper lacks specificity...avoid the asset.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Investors should feel comfortable briefly explaining the asset in some manner to a friend who may or may not be knowledgeable on the subject. If the investor can't do that, it may be appropriatee to consider a different cryptoasset.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="decentralization-edge">Decentralization Edge</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>When reading the white paper, the first question to ask is: <strong>What problem does it solve?</strong> In other words, <strong>is there a reason for this cryptoasset</strong> and its associated architecture <strong>to exist in a decentralized manner?</strong>...<strong>does this one have an inherent benefit</strong> to being provisioned in a distributed, secure, and egalitarian manner? We call this the decentralization edge. Put bluntly by Vitalik Buterin, &quot;Projects really should make sure they have good answers for 'why use a blockchain.'</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="valuation">Valuation</h2>
<p>Broadly, there are two kinds of value that the community places on any kind of cryptoasset: <strong>utility value</strong> and <strong>speculative value</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="utility-value-and-speculative-value">Utility Value and Speculative Value</h3>
<p><strong>Utility</strong> refers to <strong>the use of the cryptoasset</strong> to gain access to the digital resource its architecture provisions and is dictated by supply and demand characteristics. For Bitcoin, its utility is that it can <strong>safely, quickly, and efficiently transfer value to anyone, anywhere in the world</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Future utility value</strong> can be thought of as <strong>speculative value</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>However, <strong>at a certain point</strong> some investors may choose to <strong>exit their investments</strong> because they feel that bitcoin has <strong>reached its maximum value</strong>. In other words, those investors <strong>no longer feel bitcoin has any <em>speculative value</em> left</strong>, and instead its <strong>price is <em>only</em> supported by <em>current utility value</em></strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>utility value = akin to current use value</li>
<li>speculative value = akin to future utility value</li>
</ul>
<p>To <strong>calculate if maximum value has been reached</strong>, two concepts need to be explored: <strong>velocity of money</strong> and <strong>discounting</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="velocity-in-the-context-of-valuation">Velocity in the Context of Valuation</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The <strong>velocity of money</strong> is the frequency at which one unit of currency is used to purchase domestically-produced goods and services within a given time period...<strong>it is the number of times one dollar is spent to buy goods and services per unit of time.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<pre style="background-color:#f5f5f5;color:#1f1f1f;"><code><span>
</span><span>velocity of money = GDP for time period / total money supply
</span><span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>For example, if GDP is $20 trillion and money supply is $5 trillion, then velocity is 4. Currently, the velocity of the USD is a little north of 5.</p>
<p>The global remittances market — granting actors the ability to send money to one another internationally — is a graspable example use case of bitcoin.</p>
<p>$500 billion is transmitted annually through thte remittances market. Assuming BTC serviced the entire market, <strong>then to figure out the value of BTC, one would need to assume its velocity</strong>.</p>
<pre style="background-color:#f5f5f5;color:#1f1f1f;"><code><span>
</span><span>total remittance market = 500 billion
</span><span>assumed velocity of BTC = 5
</span><span>BTC supply = 21 million
</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span>value of a BTC = (500 billion / 5) / 21 million = $4,762
</span><span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>This is an overly simplistic model, BTC would not service the entire remittance market. There needs to be an assumtion to the % BTC services in the remittance market. Another market BTC would have a use case, is the investable gold market. With these additive use cases for BTC, <strong>valuation is found from adding together their respective market valuations</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="discounting-in-the-context-of-valuation">Discounting in the Context of Valuation</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The next concept necessary for <strong>determining the present value</strong> of one bitcoin is <strong>discounting future values back to the present</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Discounting is simply the reverse of accruing interest.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Example: $100 yielding 5% annually, means in 1 year you'll have $105 and in 2 years, $110.25, because you earn 5% on $105. Therefor you either want $100 now or $110.25 in 2 yrs — both are worth the same to you.</p>
<p>Analysts use the discounting method to figure how much they should pay for something now if it is expected to be worth more in the future.</p>
<p>It is easy to manipulate models to show an asset is under or overe valued, but these models are nonetheless useful to give investors some bearing on what they are paying for.</p>
