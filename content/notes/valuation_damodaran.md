## 3 Approaches to Valuation

From https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/webcastvalonline.htm.

- Intrinsic Value
    - Cashflows, discount rate that prices in risk, growth, time horizon, etc.
    - Focus is just on the business. Valuation is on its intrinsic characteristics.
    - Designed for cashflow-generating assets, as opposed to, e.g., a Picasso painting or gold.
    - Discounted cashflows valuation: Expected cashflows over time.
        - Can adjust for risk in the cashflow value or the discount rate.
        - If in the cashflow, use the Certaintiy Equivalent cashflow (CE). E.g. $90 risk-free vs $100 w/risk. In this scenario CE's and risk-free rates are used as inputs.
    - Financial balance sheet (not accounting)
        - Assets: In-place assets, growth assets
        - Liabilities: Debt and equity (fund a biz by borrowing or use own money)
- Relative Value
    - Comps from similar companies -- comparied numerically via a multiple. P/E, P/B, etc.
- Option Pricing
    - Valuation is determined based on contengencies.
    - Debt-laiden, distrressed company.
    - Pharmancuetical who's medicine is based on government/patent approval.
    - Oil and gas company where outcomes are based on whether or not oil is found in target area.
