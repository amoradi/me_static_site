**random experiment**: is a mechanism that produces a definite outcome that cannot be predicted with certainty

**sample space**: associated with a random experiment is the set of all possible outcomes

**event**: is a subset of the sample space

An event E is said to **occur** on a particular trial of the experiment if the outcome observed is an element of the set E.

The **probability of an outcome** e in a sample space S is a number p between 0 and 1 that measures the likelihood that e will occur on a single trial of the corresponding random experiment. The value p = 0 corresponds to the outcome e being impossible and the value p = 1 corresponds to the outcome e being certain.

The **probability of an event** A is the sum of the probabilities of the individual outcomes of which it is composed. It is denoted P(A).

## Takeaways

- The sample space of a random experiment is the collection of all possible outcomes.
- An event associated with a random experiment is a subset of the sample space.
- The probability of any outcome is a number between 0 and 1. The probabilities of all the outcomes add up to 1.
- The probability of any event A is the sum of the probabilities of the outcomes in A.
