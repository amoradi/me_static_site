> To go from good to great requires a deep understanding of three intersecting circles translated into a simple, crystalline concept (the Hedgehog Concept).
> - What are you **deeply passionate about?**
> - What you **can be the best in the world at?**
> - What drives your **econmic engine?**

> The key is to understand what your organization can be the best in the world at, and equally important what it cannot be the best at — not what it "wants" to be the best at. The Hedgehog Concept is **not a goal, strategy, or itention, it is an understanding**.

> If you cannot be the best in the world at your core business, then your business cannot form the basis of your Hedgehog Concept.

> The "best in the world" understanding is a **much more sever standard** than a **core competence.** You **might have a compentenc**e but **not necessarily have the capacity** to be truly the best in the world at that compentence. Conversely, there may be activities at which **you could become the best in the world**, but at which **you have no current competence**.

> To get insight into drivers of your econmic engine, **search for the one denominator** that has the **single greatest impact**.

> Good-to-great companies set their goals and strategies **based on understanding**; comparison companies set their goals and strategies **based on bravado**.

## Unexpected Findings

> The good-to-great companies are more like hedgehogs — simple, **dowdy creatures** that **know "one big thing" and stick to it.** The comparison companies are more like foxes — crafty, cunning creatures that **know many things** yet **lack consistency.**

> It took **four years on average** for the good-to-great companies **to get a Hedgehog Concept.**

> **Strategy per se did not separate the good-to-great companies from the comparison companies.** Both sets had strategies, and there is no evidence that the good-to-great companies spent more time on strategic planning that the comparison companies.

> You absolutely **do not need to be in a great industry** to produce sustained great results. No matter how bad the industry, every good-to-great company figured out how to produce truly superior econmic returns.
