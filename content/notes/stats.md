## 1.1 The Basic of Statistics
**Statistics**
The science of collecting, organizing, analyzing, and interpreting data to make decisions.

An **individual** refers to a person or object of interest. The collecton of all individuals to be studied is called a **population**. A **sample** is a subset of the population being studied.

A **parameter** is a numerical summary of a **population**.
A **statistic** is a numerical summary of a **sample**.

**Inferential Statistics** 
Is the process of taking a result from a sample and extending it to the population sampled from while measuring the reliability of the result.

It is often the case that time, money, and resources limit the ability of a researcher to collect data. In these cases, the researcher might consider sampling from the population.

**Descriptive Statistcs**
Involves the organizing and summarizing of data. Some common tools in the process are tables, graphs, and numberical summaries.

It is a very important aspect of research, as it allows us to get an overview of what the data is telling us.

## The Process of Statistics
- Identify the research objective.
- Collect the information needed to answer the research objective.
- Describe the data.
- Perform inference.
- Measure the reliability of the inference.

## 1.2 Data Classification
**Qualitative (or categorical) variables** are variables whose possible values represent 
categories, labels, etc. that are not numerical measures of counts.

**Quantitative variables** are variables whose possible values are numeerical measurements or counts.

A variable is at the **nominal level of measurement** if the possible values of the variable represent names, labels, or categories that don't have a meaningful rank or order.

A variable is at the **ordinal level of measurement** if the possible values of the variable represent names, labels, or categories and have a meaningufl rank or order.

When the value of zero means the absence of the quantity, we have an **inherent zero**.

A variable is at the **interval level measurement** if the values of variable:
- Have a meaningful order
- Meaningful difference between values
- A value of zero does not mean the absence of the quantity. In this case, we say that the value of zero is not an **inherent zero**.

A variable is at the **ratio level of measurement** if the values of the variable:
- Have a meaningful order,
- Meaningful difference between values,
- The value of zero is an **inherent zero**.

A quantitative variable is **discrete** if its possible values can be listed.

A quantitative variable is **continuous** if its possible values cannot be listed.

## 1.3 Simple Random Sampling

**Frame**: a list of all individuals.

**Simple random sampling** occurs when every sample of size n from a population of size N is equally likely to be selected.

**Sampling with replacement** occurs when each individual selected from the population is put back in the population before the next selection (and so could be potentially included in the sample more than once.)

**Sampling without replacement** occurs when each individual selected from the population is removed from the population before the next selection so that the individual cannot be included in the sample more than once.

## 1.4 Other Sampling Methods

**Convenience sampling** is a sampling technique where subjects are selected because of their convenient accessibility to the researcher.

This sampling technique is very popular because it is fast, inexpensive, and easy to do. Unfortunately, studies that use convenience sampling generally cannot be trusted.

**Stratified sampling** is a sampling technique where the population is separated into disjoint (non-overlapping) groups called **strata**, and then a simple random sample from each **stratum** is obtained.

Random sample **within** all groups.

**Cluster sampling** is a sampling technique where the population is separated into disjoint groups, a simple random sample of groups are selected, and every individual or a random sample of individuals within the selected groups are observed.

Random sample **among** all groups. Once random groups are selected, every individual within the groups is selected.

**Systematic sampling** is a sampling technique where every kth individual in the population is selected after some random start. Usually, the random start is determined by selecting a random number between 1 and k.

## 1.5 Sample Bias

If the sample is not representative of the population, then the sample has **bias**...if the sampling technique used tends to favor one part of the population over the another, then we have **sampling bias**.
