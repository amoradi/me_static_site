An **individual** refers to a person or object of interest. The collecton of all individuals to be studied is called a **population**. A **sample** is a subset of the population being studied.

A **parameter** is a numerical summary of a **population**.
A **statistic** is a numerical summary of a **sample**.

**Inferential Statistics** 
Is the process of taking a result from a sample and extending it to the population sampled from while measuring the reliability of the result.

It is often the case that time, money, and resources limit the ability of a researcher to collect data. In these cases, the researcher might consider sampling from the population.

**Descriptive Statistcs**
Involves the organizing and summarizing of data. Some common tools in the process are tables, graphs, and numberical summaries.

It is a verey important as\pect of research, as it allows us to get an overview of what the data is telling us.

## The Process of Statistics
- Identify the research objective.
- Collect the information needed to answer the research objective.
- Describe the data.
- Perform inference.
- Measure the reliability of the inference.

## 1.2 Data Classification
**Qualitative (or categorical) variables** are variables whose possible values represent 
categories, labels, etc. that are not numerical measures of counts.

**Quantitative variables** are variables whose possible values are numeerical measurements or counts.
