I've been building a concentrated growth portfolio around a simple thesis: **bet on civilization's infrastructure, buy quality in pairs.**

The "two by two" approach means every investment theme gets two positions — one for redundancy, one for diversification within the thesis. If I'm right about the theme but wrong about the stock, I've got a backup. If I'm right about both, even better.

## The 13 Themes

| Theme | Pair | Why |
|-------|------|-----|
| Payment Rails | V + MA | Duopoly that clips every transaction |
| Credit Ratings | SPGI + MCO | Another duopoly — debt needs ratings |
| Big Tech | GOOG + AMZN | Cloud + AI infrastructure |
| Semis Infrastructure | ASML + TSM | Can't make chips without them |
| Semis Design | NVDA + SNPS | AI's picks and shovels |
| Subscription Consumer | NFLX + DUOL | Sticky recurring revenue |
| Insurance | UNH + FRFHF | Healthcare + Buffett-style float |
| Crypto/Fintech | HOOD + COIN | The future of finance (I'm early) |
| Energy/Commodities | XOM + Sogo Shosha | Old economy ballast |
| Sports/Entertainment | MSGS + GENI | Trophy assets + sports data |
| EV | TSLA + BYDDY | Both sides of the EV race |
| Aerospace | GE + TDG | Jet engines + aftermarket parts |
| Hardware | AAPL + DELL | Consumer premium + enterprise AI |

That's 30 positions across 13 themes. The Sogo Shosha (MITSY, MSBHF, ITOCY, MARUY, SSUMY) trade as a single basket — Japan's commodity trading houses that Buffett has been accumulating.

## What the Optimizer Said

I ran mean-variance optimization with a 1% floor and 10% ceiling per position. The math wanted to:

**Max out (10% each):** NVDA, GE, GOOG, SNPS, NFLX, FRFHF, and the Sogo Shosha basket

**Minimize (1% each):** GENI, UNH, MSGS, HOOD, COIN, TSLA

The optimizer doesn't hate my speculative names — it just says their volatility (75-85% for HOOD/COIN) needs to be sized appropriately. Even at 25% expected returns, the risk-adjusted math favors lower-volatility compounders.

## Risk Reality Check

This is a **growth portfolio**, not an all-weather portfolio. Some honest numbers:

- **Portfolio Sharpe: 0.80** (vs SPY at 0.44)
- **Expected return: 22%** (optimized weights)
- **Crisis drawdown estimate: -40% to -50%**

Tech/AI represents 37% of weight but nearly 50% of risk. NVDA alone is 19% of portfolio risk — not because it's overweight, but because its volatility (55%) and correlation to other holdings amplify through the portfolio.

My hedges are FRFHF (Fairfax Financial — Prem Watsa's insurance float machine) and the Sogo Shosha basket. Both stay relatively uncorrelated when tech sells off.

## Why Not Equal Weight?

I tested it. Equal weighting is actually **more** stressful — it gives the same vote to NVDA (a compounder) and GENI (a drag). The speculative cluster goes from 10% of risk to 39% of risk with equal weights.

The optimizer earned its keep by overweighting diversifiers and minimizing landmines.

## The Bottom Line

This portfolio makes a bet: **civilization keeps building, technology keeps compounding, and quality businesses keep winning.**

If you believe the next decade looks promising, these are the companies I want to own.

Long civilization. Two by two.
