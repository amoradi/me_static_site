## Manager vs Leader

Manangers in the pegoritive


hungry, humble, smart

team focused

greedy ($ or power), prideful, cunning (inteligence is not the issue here, it's emotional/manipulative intelligence that's the driver)

me focused

- as parasites: assign the work, don't do the work, get final and ulitimate credit for the work
- convene the meeting, listen to ideas, take ideas as their own -- offer no real creative, generative, or visionary value, only capture value
    - ultimately filter and have final say on the direction and idea choices
- do menial tasks to ensure the work gets done, don't actually do the work, and finally get credit for the work
    - credit comes in bonuses, higher salaries, and public commendation, and all this while doing less work
- have access to more data on people and processes (being higher up the pyramid) and using that knowledge edge to
    - cover current issues (when they are in the blame)
    - make light of current issues to avoid reprocussions
- when they are in fault, only privately admit such, never admit it publicly/to the team, only on an individual basis
- when apololgizing, do it only in words, ever back it with action
- use passive inaction and time to your advantage (enough for your vesting period)
- be motivated by money, power and doing less work
- require direct reports to give progress updates in writing, however don't do your updates in writing
    - keep that level of transparency and candidcy for individual contributers only (2 class system)
- take more vacation than your reports
- downplay any competition and uplay your preceived strengths (perception is reality, not truth)
    - weight "cheap" skills (planning, project management, looking at data) higher than creative, hard-to-master-hard-to-aquire skills
- never divudge any unecessary information to anyone, stay guarded and obfiscate 
    - only answer when directly asked, and then, only answer with halftruths. remember your knowledge asymetry is part of your edge.
- demotivate and press to leave all unfavorable competion, but do it in the most clandestine way
    - be to the public friendly and fair
    - when "grades" are made by you the judge, be sure to always grade at the lowest acceptable grade
- comeup with silly improvements to keep people busy s

Managers as "leaders"






Manangers are the defacto leaders. They guide, watch, maitain, 


Graphs are an essential data structure in computer science for modeling networks.

- **vertex**: A node in a graph.
- **edge**: A connection between two vertices.
- **adjacent**: When an edge exists between vertices.
- **path**: A sequence of one or more edges between vertices.
- **disconnected**: Graph where at least two vertices have no path connecting them.
- **weighted**: Graph where edges have an associated cost.
- **directed**: Graph where travel between vertices can be restricted to a single direction.
- **cycle**: A path which begins and ends at the same vertex.
- **adjacency matrix**: Graph representation where vertices are both the rows and the columns. Each cell represents a possible edge.
- **adjacency list**: Graph representation where each vertex has a list of all the vertices it shares an edge with.
