> All good-to-great companies began the process of finding a path to greatness by **confronting the brutal facts of their current reality.**

> When you start with an honest and diligent effort to determine the truth of your situation, **the right decisions often become self-evident.** It is impossible to make good decisions without infusing the entire process with an **honest confrontation of the brutal facts.**

> A primary task in taking a company from good to great is to create a culture wherein people have a tremendous opportunity to be heard and, ultimately, for **truth to be heard.**

> Creating a climate where the truth is heard involves four basic practices:
>  - **lead with questions**
>  - engage in dialogue and not debate not coercion
>  - **conduct autopsies, without blame**
>  - build red flag mechanisms that turn information into **information that cannot be ignored**

> good-to-great companies faced just as much adversity as the comparision companies, but responded to that adversity differently. **They hit the realities of their situation head-on.** As a result, they emerged from adverstiy even stronger.

> the **Stockdale Paradox**: Retain **absolute faith** that you **can and will prevail**, and, at the same time, **confront the most brutal facts of your current reality.**

> Leadership does not begin just with vision. It begins with getting people to confront the brutal facts and to act on the implications.

> Spending time and energy trying to "motivate" people is a waste of effort. The real question is not, "How do we motivate our people?". If you have the right people, they will be self-motivated. **The key is to not de-motivate them.** One of the primary ways to de-motivate people is to ignore the brutal facts of reality.
