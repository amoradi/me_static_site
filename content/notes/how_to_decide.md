- Resulting
    - A mental shortcut in which we use the **quality of an outcome to figure out the quality of a decision.**
- Hindsight bias
    - The tendency to believe that an outcome, after it occurs, was predictable or inevitable.
    - Like resulting, is a manifestation of the outsized influence of outcomes. **The outcome casts a shadow over your ability to accurately remember what you knew** at the time of the decision.
- Memory creep
    - **Post outcome knowledge creeps into your memory of what you knew** or was knowable before the decision was made.
- Counuterfactual
    - A what-if. A possible outcome of a decision that is not the one that actually occured. An imagined, hypothetical state of the world.
