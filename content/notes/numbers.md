Mathematicians have named five families of numbers over the centuries. Four are listed below.

| Category | Symbol | Definition | Purpose | Other |
| -------- | ------ | ---------- | ------- | ----- |
| natural | N | 1, 2, 3,... | Counting | Some mathmeticians include 0 |
| integers | Z | ..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3,... | Counting changes | Includes all natural numbers |
| rational | Q (quotient)| `n/d` for any integers `n` and `d` not 0 | Measuring size or change in size / comparing size | Includes all integers. Can also be representated in decimals and percentages.
| real | R | decimals | Measuring size or change in size, including any possible length, locating on the number line | Some numbers are represented by a symbol or letter. Real numbers that aren't rational are called irrational (never ending decimals [hence written as symbols]). Famous ones include: &radic;2 and &#960; |

Note: Symbols are noramlly styled in font blackboard bold by mathematicians.

The letter symbols in this table are used to make statements about what families each number are a part of purely in mathematical notation. The symbol that is used to say whether a number is in a family is &isin;.

- &isin;: "is in"
  - 2 &isin; N, 2 is in the natural numbers
  - full statement: 2 &isin; N, 2 &isin; Z, 2 &isin; Q, 2 &isin; R
- &notin;: "is not in"
  - &#960; &notin; N is not in the natural numbers
  - full statement:  &#960; &notin; N,  &#960; &notin; Z,  &#960; &notin; Q,  &#960; &isin; R


`N Z Q R`

- All N &isin; Z, Q and R
- All Z &isin; Q and R
- All Q &isin; R
